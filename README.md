# Connect 4 Neural Network

Attempt to train a neural network with Tensor Flow to play and win Connect 4.
This project is based on the work by Carl Friedrich, where a several types of neural network learn to play tic-tac-toe. More info at https://github.com/fcarsten/tic-tac-toe.

## Visual Interface
The state of a game can be printed in console showing an output similar to the following:

## Neural Network Results
So far, using a simple neural network with Q-Learning the results are as follows:
Notice: player 1 is the trained neural network

## To be continued..
user interface to be added in order to play against the trained neural network.
